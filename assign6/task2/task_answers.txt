The control bit flag is NX = 1, f = 1, no = 1, X = 9 (0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1001) and Y = 5 (0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101). When NX = 1, it inverts X to -9 (0b1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0111). When f = 1, the output is X + Y, which is (0b1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0111) + (0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101) = (0b1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100), in decimal is (-9) + (5) = (-4). no is invert the output, which is change (0b1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1100) to (0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100), in decimal is 4. In other words, this control flag means X - Y; for example, 9 - 5 = 4.

The control bit flag is NX = 1, f = 1, no = 1, X = 9 and Y = 5. NX is invert X to -9. When f = 1, the output is X + Y, which is (-9) + 5 = -4. no is invert the output, which is change (-4) to 4. This control flag means 9 - 5 = 4.
