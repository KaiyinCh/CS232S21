Stack frame includes the return address, argument variables passed on the stack, and local variable. The minimun stack frame size is 32 bytes and no maximun stack frame size is defined. I think the stack frame size of printSumRangeRecursive is dependent on the operating system. The operating system creates the stack when a process is initialized. The memory allocated at stack frame may be at compile time or run time.
