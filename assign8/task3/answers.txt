1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?
  cmpl $6,-4(%ebp)
2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?
  The "jmp" instruction means unconditional jump. We used "jpm" in the while loop, which means when finished the instructions in the while-loop then go back to check the condition statement again. If we delete the "jmp" instruction, this loop will became a if-loop.

3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle” without changing semantic of the program? Why or why not?
  "jg" means jump if greater, and "jle" means jump if less or equal. The original statement is "if(a > 6)", in the instruction is "cmpl $6,-4(%ebp)  jle .L2".if it change to "if(7 <= a)" will have the same meaning. Therefore, "jle" can not replace "jg" without changing semantic of the program.
